ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project!

Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™ve recently developed an AI-powered psychological chat app for iOS, built entirely with Swift.

The app is designed to provide users with a safe, supportive space to talk through their thoughts and emotions using advanced AI. It offers meaningful, empathetic conversations to help people reflect, de-stress, and feel heard â€” anytime, anywhere.

Mental health matters, and my goal was to create a tool thatâ€™s always there for you, right in your pocket. ðŸ§ ðŸ“±

This has been an incredible journey in combining technology and emotional well-being, and Iâ€™m excited to keep improving it.
